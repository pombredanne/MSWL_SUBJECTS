This file includes a list of TODOs that could be added to the arsespyder Web crawler for it to contain enhanced functionality:

1) Include a "-t" option for a tree view. If this option was included, once provided by the user, the links should appear on a tree basis, to identify which link depends on which one. Format, up on this option provided, should be as follows:

-- http://level_1_a.link.org/
|  |
|  +-- http://level_2_a_a.link.org
|  +-- http://level_2_a_b.link.org
|
-- http://level_1_b.link.org/
|  |
|  +-- http://level_2_b_a.link.org
|  |   |
|  |   +-- http://level_3_b_a_a.link.org   
|  |   +-- http://level_3_b_a_b.link.org   
|  |
|  +-- http://level_2_b_b.link.org
|   
-- http://level_1_c.link.org/
   |
   +-- http://level_2_c_a.link.org

2) Include a "-a" option to enable autocompletion of URLs for those cases where a URL link is not of the format "http://whatever.org/test.html" and just the file name "test.html". 
   As the URL containing the link is known, i.e: "http://whatever.org", links from root URL pointing to a non "http://" url link should be auto-completed with the parent url link.

3) Include a "-c" option to allow indicating the character to print to identify the level of a certain link. Right now, only '*' character can be specified
