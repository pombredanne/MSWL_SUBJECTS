Q1) Benkler presents a diagram showing different positions for product or services according to the type of management (centralized / decentralized) and economic profitability (market / non-market). He characterizes all his examples in this presentation falling in the non-market/decentralized space. Find counterexamples of enterprises like Crowdspring, making economic profit from a decentralized, crowdsourced platform (if possible, outside the FLOSS sector).

A1) As stated before, Crowdspring is an enterprise that allows to ask for a certain small business to a particular customer, and asks for users to propose ideas, prototypes or sketches in a private way. 
Customer selects one final user, and start cooperating with the user to get the final Business. Among the business, some possibilities to initiate are:
- A web design.
- A logo design.
- Print design.
- Graphic design.
- Writing.
  Crowdspring earns money with a little percentage of each business that is finally arised.

  Another example making economic profit from a decentralized model is the Crowdfunding projects web pages. Sites like Kick-Starter (and a high bunch of competitors to it, like "Lanzanos" in Spain), allow people to publish projects that need to be funded. Normally, funds are oriented to micro-funds where the people that donate the money receives something in exchange. 
  Crowdfunding sites take profit from this model by taking a little percentage of the total funds. In case of Kick-Starter, this percentage is 5%. Taking into account that Kick-Started was successful to fund projects more than 3000 projects, and some of them were up to 10 million dollars, this model is not a bad business.

  More examples of a decentralized model working is InnoCentive. This Web-Based platform community enables matching scientists to research and development challenges presented by companies worldwide.

  Last, but not least, a mention to Spigit. Spigit is a technology company that provides a software platforms for enterprise innovation management.
  Among their products, they offer Free Private Crowdsourcing tools to companies. Based on this tool, they offer an entry point for other products of the company.
