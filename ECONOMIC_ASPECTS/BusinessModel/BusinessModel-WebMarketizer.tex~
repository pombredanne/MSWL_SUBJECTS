\section{Introduction}
\textbf{Web Marketizer SL} is a company whose main vision is to develop reports of Market Share associated to on line sales companies.\\
In order to achieve its mission, Web Marketizer will be based on \textbf{WebMarketizer FLOSS project}, which is a tool, to be developed, that will allow, once correctly configured, connection to on-line sales web pages and automatic extraction of sale data, such as the type of product, the trademark of the product, the link and of course, the price.\\
The company will sell reports associated to this data to other companies, in order for them to understand the products price in other on-line sale companies, the mean price in the market for a specific product or type of product, the number of different product of each store and, in general, all the on-line market share information that can help a particular company to adjust its strategy to the customer requirements.\\
Apart from that, Web Marketizer will create a Web Page for all the people to be able to consult, in a costless way, data and price for a product on the different on-line sale webs.
