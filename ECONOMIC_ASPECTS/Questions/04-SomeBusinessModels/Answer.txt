    Canonical:
    Canonical is a company founded by Mark Shuttleworth and based on FLOSS. Canonical main product is the Ubuntu Linux Distribution, and its multiple variants.
    Canonical Ltd. financial results are not as clear as Red Hat's ones, so it is more difficult to identify their business plan.
    However, Canonical business model is oriented to be more or less the same as Red Hat's one, as Canonical main product is also a Linux Distribution, and its founder idea was to provide services around software, such as technical suppport, training services, and other services such as cloud services [2].
