How do you imagine free software in year 2022? In particular, do you think it will be a mainstream model for producing software? Or maybe it will be reduced to some specific niches? (which ones?) Or maybe it will be reduced to irrelevant? And in any case, why?

As a side question, for the main IT device in use by that year, how much free software will be delivered in it, typically? (Just say a percentage)
