OSI maintains a list of software licenses recognized as conformat with their definition of “open source software”. FSF maintains a list of software licenses recognized as conformant with their definition of “free software”. 

QUESTION 1) Please, analyze both list, and focus in the differences. Try to know whether they correspond with licenses that were not analyzed by one of the two bodies, or if they have been rejected as not conformant with their definition.

(*1) : They are considered superceeded in OSI, or the author has retired them.
(*2) : Considered as not free software license by FSF.

Mainly, all differences are because the fact that the other organization has not analyzed the license in particular.
EXCEPTIONS:
-----------
On the one hand, next licenses, considered as "No Free Software" license by FSF are: 
- NASA Open Source Agreement 1.3 (NASA 1.3): 
  The NASA Open Source Agreement, version 1.3, is not a free software license because it includes a provision requiring changes to be your “original creation”. Free software development depends on combining code from third parties, and the NASA license doesn't permit this.
- Reciprocal Public License 1.5 (RPL-1.5): 
  The Reciprocal Public License is a nonfree license because of three problems. 
  1. It puts limits on prices charged for an initial copy. 
  2. It requires notification of the original developer for publication of a modified version. 
  3. It requires publication of any modified version that an organization uses, even privately.
- Sybase Open Watcom Public License 1.0 (Watcom-1.0):
  This is not a free software license. It requires you to publish the source code publicly whenever you “Deploy” the covered software, and “Deploy” is defined to include many kinds of private use.

On the other hand, next licenses, as stated before, appear on FSF, but are considered superseeded in OSI: 
- Common Public License Version 1.0
- Jabber Open Source License Version 1.0
- Sun Industry Standards Source License 1.0
- There is an aditional exception, which is Public Domain. OSI explains on next link:
  "http://opensource.org/faq#public-domain"
that Public Domain is, for practical purposes, Open Source. It states that: 
'"Public domain" is a technical term in copyright law that refers to works not under copyright .... Not all jurisdictions have a public domain, and it doesn't always mean exactly the same thing in the jurisdictions that do have it.'
They recommend, basically, to better apply an approved Open Source license to software being released.

QUESTION 2) Explain to which extent these differences are important or not (in terms of how similar the interpretation of both bodies is of “open source software” and “free software”).
ANSWER 2) Basically, the list of common licenses is big enough to ensure that, nearly in 90% (6/44) of the cases, a license that is open source software is also free software.
  Moreover this, there are a lot of licenses that have not been analyzed by both organizations, but that will surely hint or not the category of Free Software or Open Source software simultaneously.
  So, apart from those extrange cases where FSF and OSI states that some licenses analyzed by both are Free Software but not Open Source Software or viceversa, differences are not that important, and classification of licenses is very similar by both organizations.
