\title{The Libre Software Forgotten Names}
\author{Sergio Arroutbi}
\date{12 October 2012}

\section* {Introduction}

Richard Stallman, Linus Torvalds, Donald Ervin Knuth, Bruce Perens, Eric Schmidt, Miguel de Icaza, Mattias Ettrich, ... There is a bunch of recognized names in Free Software world.\\ 
Meanwhile, on the other hand, there is a much bigger bunch of names that are not as recognized as they should.\\
The aim of this text is to bring those names back to memory, in order to recognize their contribution to the Open Source Community, obviously, from a very personal point of view.

\section* {Applications}

Software Applications is, in all probability, the most productive scope of the Libre Software movement. In fact, the main idea of the movement is around software itself, although other technology fields have incorporated the idea as well, as Linux Distributions or Programming Languages theirselves.
Here, follows a List with what I considered great contributors to Libre Software Philosophy:\\
\\
\underline{Brian J. Fox:}\\
Active developer of the FSF. Author of GNU Bash, GNU Makeinfo, GNU Info, GNU Finger, and readline libraries.\\
\\
\underline{Alan Cox:}\\
One of the first Linux kernel instalators, Cox discovered and fixed many of existing bugs and went on to rewrite much of the networking subsystem. 
He then became one of the main developers and maintainers of the whole kernel.
He has also been involved in the GNOME and X.Org projects.\\
\\
\underline{Mark Spencer:}\\
Computer engineer, original author of the GTK instant messaging client Gaim (renamed to Pidgin).

\\
\underline{Theodore Y. "Ted" Ts'o:}\\

\\
\underline{Harald Welte:}\\
German programmer, well known as a hacker of the Linux kernel, enforcer of the GNU General Public License (GPL).  Also involved in a number of free software projects, such as Openmoko, (a version of Linux for completely open, low-cost, high-volume phones) and the netfilter/iptables project.\\
\\
