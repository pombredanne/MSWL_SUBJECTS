Notabilia (http://notabilia.net/) is a project aimed at visualizing the 100 longest article for deletion discussions in the English Wikipedia.

Choose 3 of these discussions at random and answer the following questions:

Q1) In general, Â¿do you think that participants follow standard netiquette guidelines?
A1) To start with, I have chosen next 3 discussions for deletion on next topics:
    - Islamophobiaphobia [1]
    - Dead Playboy Playmates [2]
    - Allegations of state terrorism by United States [3]

    The discussions held around both 3 topics, are ruled by netiquette guidelines, although some editors sometimes do ignore some of them:
    Some netiquette rules used, such as:
    - They start with a key (Keep/Delete/Merge) to decide if the article has to be kept / deleted.
    - They normally (not always) include a reason about why the Keep/Delete decission is being taken.
    - In general, no offense is provided. 
    - No cappital letters are used.
    - Identation is used to discussion on certain Keep/Delete decissions.
    - Each of the entries in the discussion are being signed.
    However, some netiquette rules are being ignored [1], such as:
    - Avoid "Me Too" messages: i.e.: Delete. "Per above". 
    - Avoid sarcasm: i.e.: messages such as: "You have to be kidding" 
    - Avoid offensive messages: i.e.: "Delete. Silliness"

Q2) Can you find any specific guidelines in the Wikipedia project concerning this matter?
A2) Yes, there is a specific guideline containing how to keep friendly discussions on what Wikipedia calls "talk pages" [2].
    The main objectives to accomplish on this type of talk pages are:
    - Communicate
    - Stay on topic
    - Be positive
    - Stay objective
    - Deal with facts
    - Share material
    - Discuss edits
    - Make proposals
    Good practices proposed by this guidelines are:
    - Checking no other similar discussion exist
    - Comment on content, not on contributor
    - Sign the posts
    - Be concise
    - Keep clear layout
    - Keep discussion focused
    - Read the archives
    - Be welcome to newcomers
    - Use minor flag for minor changes only
    - Avoid excessive emphasize
    - Use English
    - Avoid posting the same threads
    - Avoid repeating
    - Use wiklinks
    Last, but obviously not least, next issues are considered to be unacceptable behaviour:
    - Personal attacks 
    - Misrepresentation of other people
    - Asking for other personal details
    - Impersonate other editors
    - Claim to be administrator / having an access level you do not really have 
    - Use talk page as forum, as it is intended only to be for discussions.

Q3) Do you think it is easy to follow these discussions only by using identation? Can you offer any suggestions to improve the interface to debate with other editors?
A3) Yes, from my perspective identation is a very easy way to follow the discussion, as graphically it can be easy understood which points are referring to other ones. 
    Despite the fact that identation can be ankward to follow if long discussions are taken, there are some resources, such as "Outdent Template" [6], to fix this kind of issue.
    From my point of view, the interface provided to debates is easily understandable and provide a good mechanisnms to discuss the issues. In order to improve the interface to debate, I would only add some graphics to dinamically keep track of what is being going on in the debate, such as, for example, a bar diagram to include tracking of the different Keep/Delete/Merge votes that editors have included in the debate.
