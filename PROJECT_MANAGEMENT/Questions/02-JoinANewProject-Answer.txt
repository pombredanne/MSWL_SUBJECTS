Let's assume that you are a developer interested in joining the Calligra project, an office suite in KDE. Answer the following questions:

Q1) Is it possible to browse the code tree of these projects? What is the URL of this repository? What is the software for version control used in this project?
A1) As Free Software Project, obviously, code can be downloaded and browsed as well. 
    The URL of this repository for the code of Calligra to be downloaded is:  git://anongit.kde.org/calligra
    As the URL shows, Control Version system is GIT.

Q2) Can you find any specific guidelines for submitting your first patch to this project (or any other KDE project)?
    In order to push changes, an identity of "KDE developer" is necessary. To obtain such identity, someone must: 
    1 - Initiate a user registration process [2]
    2 - Agree the terms of the "KDE code of conduct" [3]
    3 - Once registered as user, fill a form to obtain the developer role, with information associated to your development issues, such as [4]:  
        -> Supporter (if any).
        -> Supporting evidence, as, in example, providing mail list links issuing your fixes, reviewing requests, etc.
        -> Reasons to apply for being KDE developer.
