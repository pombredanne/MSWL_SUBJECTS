Notabilia (http://notabilia.net/) is a project aimed at visualizing the 100 longest article for deletion discussions in the English Wikipedia.

Choose 3 of these discussions at random and answer the following questions:

Q1) In general, Â¿do you think that participants follow standard netiquette guidelines?
A1) To start with, I have chosen next 3 discussions for deletion on next topics:
    - Islamophobiaphobia:                              http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Islamophobiaphobia
    - Dead Playboy Playmates:                          http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Dead_Playboy_Playmates
    - Allegations of state terrorism by United States: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Allegations_of_state_terrorism_by_the_United_States

    The discussions held around both 3 topics, are ruled by netiquette guidelines, although not in a very strict way:
    Some netiquette rules are used, such as:
    - They start with a key (Keep/Delete) to decide if the article has to be kept / deleted.
    - They normally (not always) include a reason about why the Keep/Delete decission is being taken.
    - No offense is provided. 
    - No cappital letters are used.
    - Identation is used to discussion on certain Keep/Delete decissions.
    However, some netiquette rules are being ignored [1], such as:
    - Avoid "Me Too" messages: i.e.: Delete. "Per above". 
    - Avoid sarcasm: i.e.: messages such as: "You have to be kidding" 
    - Avoid offensive messages: i.e.: "Delete. Silliness"

Q2) Can you find any specific guidelines in the Wikipedia project concerning this matter?
A2) Yes, there is a specific guideline containing how to keep friendly discussions [2].

Q3) Do you think it is easy to follow these discussions only by using identation? Can you offer any suggestions to improve the interface to debate with other editors?
A3)
