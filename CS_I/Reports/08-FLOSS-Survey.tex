increasing of importance as the time goes by. An FLOSS survey was started, around year 2002, in order to address many aspects of this domain, that still appear to be unknown and misunderstood.\\
\\
Within the two months the survey duration, 2784 FLOSS developers filled the online questionnaire, providing a good basis for a analysis of the realm of FLOSS development.\\
\\
Survey results were provided, and some different conclussions were drown after the survey. However, after ten years of it. This report will inspect slightly the survey to identify the different aspects it covered.
